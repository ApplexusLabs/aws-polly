They slapped the mack That kept us back Sucker sucking the hood like crack. So if your dragging us down with the wack attitude, Get up, lookout, get out the way. Move!"

(Brothers and sisters, hey) Listen if you're missing you all Swinging while I'm singing. Giving what your getting. Knowing what I know While the Black bands sweating. And the rhythm rhymes rolling. Got to give us what we want. Gotta give us what we need. Our freedom of speech is freedom or death. We got to fight the powers that be. Lemme hear you say. Fight the power!"

Turn up the radio. They claim that I'm a criminal. By now I wonder how Some people never know The enemy could be their friend, guardian. I'm not a hooligan. I rock the party and Clear all the madness. I'm not a racist. Preach to teach to all. Because some they never had this. Don't believe the hype!"
